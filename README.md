# Phishing Website Preporting Assistant

A tool to help with reporting phishing websites to the domain seller and several security flagging databases.

This tool was designed to go with, and has a list of websites from, this video by ThioJoe on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fIUiv9-UFk
Hope it helps! TYJ, I learned how to do proper tkinter resizing while writing this :-D

This program expects firefox to be in PATH in the command to open the browser (will be the case if you are using system-package firefox on Linux), but you can edit this. I intend to incorporate strong Windows compatibility soon with webbrowser or another library, but right now it's helpful that the sites are loaded in order.

Change info in the config/log file as desired.
